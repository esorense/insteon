To make it so if would run and restart automatically did the following:
Did apt-get install daemontools-run daemontools
Then made the following directory:
/etc/service/insteon
with the file name "run" with the following permissions:
-rwxr-xr-x
#!/bin/bash
sudo -u pi python /home/pi/Insteon/insteon_scheduler_v01d01_28FEB2014.py


to restart the daemontool thing do this
sudo reboot
--or--
svc -h /service/yourdaemon: sends HUP
svc -t /service/yourdaemon: sends TERM, and automatically restarts the daemon after it dies
svc -d /service/yourdaemon: sends TERM, and leaves the service down
svc -u /service/yourdaemon: brings the service back up
svc -o /service/yourdaemon: runs the service once

did these to use git
